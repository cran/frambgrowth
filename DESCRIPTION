Description: Generation of theoretical size distributions of framboidal or sunflower pyrite. 
        The growth mechanisms used are surface and supply controlled and dependent
        or independent of size. The algorithms are fully described in the published work 
        in Mineralogy and Petrology journal:
        "Theoretical growth of framboidal and sunflower pyrite using the R-package frambgrowth"
        The authors Merinero, R., and Cardenes, V. (2018).
